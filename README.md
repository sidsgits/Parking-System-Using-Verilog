# Car Parking System FSM Verilog Project

This repository contains a Verilog-based implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) for a car parking system.

## Description
The parking system manages vehicle entry and exit based on user input (password) and sensor data. The FSM controls:
- Vehicle Entry Control
- Password Authentication
- Vehicle Exit Control
- State Management
- LED and 7-Segment Display Output
- Reset and State Transitions

## Prerequisites
- Verilog simulator (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, etc.)
- A development environment with Verilog support

## Running the Simulation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `ParkingSystemFSM_tb.v` file in your preferred simulator.
3. Run the simulation to test different scenarios (entry, exit, incorrect password, etc.).
